Did I feel these pask few weeks like I was hit on the head with "a small body of matter from outer space that entered the Earth's atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a stream of light"?....



No, not at all! Instead, I felt like I pummeled by the immaculate and powerful fists of **knowledge**! With each swing, I ironically could see more than I could before! Meteor thus far has been only a blessing for me despite, maybe, a little bit of a learning curve. I now see web app development as a much tamer animal, something that turned out to be much easier to control than I originally thought.

## The Ups

There exists a plethora of things that I enjoy about Meteor. For starters, I quite enjoy JavaScript. I would say the language sits at number three on my personal list of the most fun languages to work with, after Python and Scheme. This point leads directly into my next enjoyable thing about Meteor: JavaScript is the only programming language used. Being able to use the same language for an entire app so far seems to be easier than using different languages for the front and back ends.
I played around a little with Flask and Tornado for Python, and Meteor seems to be the most convienient of the three. 
The feature of Meteor that I enjoy the *most* would be the blurred line between the server and the web browser. It feels like I am developing a single *app*, not a server + client-side js. Meteor feels the least "hacky", and I hope it becomes more popular or canonical in the world of web dev, because I would like to have more opportunity to use it in the future.


## The Downs

There are some parts where I do not understand the syntax of the template system Blaze, but to be fair I haven't read through any Blaze documentation yet. The syntax specifically of using a function (?) such as:
```
{{pathFor 'Edit_Contact_Page' _id=contact._id  }}
```
Is a little confusing. I have assumed that "pathFor" is a Blaze function that is passed the parameters that are not in key-value pair form, and those that are are added as kv pairs of the instance object.

Also, this is not quite a down, but I do not yet see exactly where Blaze lies in terms of meta-ness, and how effectively it could be used with any other frameworks or platforms as the default template engine. I will hopefully soon look into how it works.
