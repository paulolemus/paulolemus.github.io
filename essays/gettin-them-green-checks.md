I think its funny how P.J. (ICS314 professor) mentioned:
> Many people think of "coding standards" in a trivial way - i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.
as I have always been anal about these kind of white-space formatting coding standards. I always have to have the close-curly-brace one space after a closing parenthesis on the same line, I always have to write Javadoc style comments above header file declarations, I always have to put spaces around arithmetic, relational, logical operators, I always have to line up variable declarations horizontally. I have definitely heard of some of the popular linting tools for a couple languages such
JSLint, Pylint, and Checkstyle, and it is amazing how I have never considered using one outside of an IDE that is already configured to use it. 

Using ESLint with IntelliJ for just this short week has been really eye-opening for me, and is making me regret not using a linter regularly for all my projects. The way ESLint enforces good ES6 coding style is my favorite part of the linting tool. Today, because of the red 'x' and hints in IntelliJ, I learned about JavaScript string templates which will definitely turn out to be very useful in the future. I can now move up from string concatination with '+' to using `${thing1} some
text ${thing2}`. 

At times, I can see how using ESLint constantly can get irritating, especially when you want to finish something large and red marks are popping up all over the place. I also have no doubt that ESLint will force me to learn alot whether I want to at the time or not, and I look forward to it. I know I will just HAVE to get my green checks, and ESLint provides both the motivation and assistance I need to bring all of my code up to standards.
