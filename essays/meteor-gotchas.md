Now what pains have I suffered at the hands of the Meteor platform so far? What has it done to throw me in the dirt, to kick me down, to highlight my inexperience? my answer is **nothing**! Meteor has been a blessing-not-in-disguise! 

Thus far, I am loving just about everything in Meteor from the folder structure down to the "data on the wire" communication. Using Meteor means that I can stay away from using verbose hacks such as AJAX to update a webpage with data that has been modified on the server side. A huge plus is that Meteor allows me to develop entirely in one language, JavaScript, which so far has shown itself to be simpler that building a web application with Python / Tornado in the backend, and JS in the front.

# My Few Gripes

I am mostly love for Meteor, but for the sake of variety here are a couple "gotchas" and thoughts that I have encountered or am still having difficulty with. One thing about Meteor that I've wondered about is its relative performance vs other more common frameworks and platforms. Meteor works fundamentally different in the way it uses MongoDB and how it communicated with browsers and back, what are the pros and cons of using it to build web app vs say Flask or Angular? I
should probably look this one up right now.
One difficulty I have had would be underestanding how "this" works in javaScript. This is not a Meteor gripe, however it can be used in many places in Meteor and I can use it, I just do not understand why it is what it is.
