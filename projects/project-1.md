## What is Micromouse?

Micromouse is a capstone project hosted by Dr. Tep Dobry, as well as a robotics competition hosted regionally by IEEE. The goal of the competition is to develop miniature robots resembling mice to autonomously search, solve, and complete an unknown 16x16 maze in the shortest time possible. The mouse with the fastest time to the center of the maze wins first place, and slower mice are ranked accordingly. Those mice that are unable to complete the maze are ranked based on how many unique blocks they are able to traverse.

## The Project 

I worked on this project as a 296-level (sophomore) student along with three group members; Nicole Hortizuela, Rodolfo Julian, and Chynna Taylor. We designed, built, and programmed a stepper motor mouse, controlled by a PIC18F4620 microcontroller, programmed in C. My role within the group was as team leader and lead programmer. I delegated tasks between us and provided direction when we hit blockers. I wrote the stepper motor control logic and the semi-random wall hugging algorithm that the mouse used to navigate the maze.
