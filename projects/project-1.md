Micromouse was a x96 project hosted by Dr. Tep Dobry, as well as an IEEE regional competition. Multiple teams developed miniature robots resembling mice that could completely autonomously search, solve, and complete an unknown 16x16 maze. The mouse with the fastest time to the center of the maze won first place, and slower mice ranked accordingly. Those mice that were unable to complete the maze were ranked based on how many unique blocks they were able to traverse.

I worked on this project as a 296-level student along with my three other group members; Nicole Hortizuela, Rodolfo Julian, and Chynna Taylor. We designed, built, and programmed a stepper motor mouse, controlled by a PIC18F4620 microcontroller, programmed in C. My role within the group was as team leader and lead programmer. I delegated tasks between us and provided direction when we hit blockers. I wrote the stepper motor control logic and the semi-random wall hugging algorithm that the mouse used to navigate the maze.
