## What is UHM Spacebar?

The [UHM Spacebar](http://uhmspacebar.meteorapp.com/) is a web application built with the Meteor platform and the Semantic UI framework that acts for students at UH Manoa as a convenient place to get connected with clubs on campus. It allows students to easily find new clubs they may be interested and stay connected with those they are already in.

## My Contributions

My contributions for this project were incredibly light compared to my other three team members. For the first of our two milestones I pushed the preliminary version of the ClubCollection, a class that is used for interaction with a MongoDB collection. The class wraps a Mongo collection, and uses a schema for data validation.

The project can be found on [GitHub](https://uhmspacebar.github.io/).
